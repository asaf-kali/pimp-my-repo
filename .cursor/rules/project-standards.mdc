## Python Standards
- **Version:** Always target Python 3.14+ features and syntax.
- **Arguments:** Always use keyword arguments (**kwargs**) for function calls and definitions.
- **Modeling:** Use Pydantic models for structured data; never use `tuple`. Break complex types into small, named models.
- **Type Hinting:** Use strict type hints. Use `typing.Protocol` for unknown third-party interfaces.

## Logic & Control Flow
- **Guard Clauses:** Use "reverse-if" logic (Early Returns).
    - *Bad:* `if condition: [long block of code]`
    - *Good:* `if not condition: return/raise`. Then proceed with logic at the top level of the function.
- **Indentation:** Maximum of **2 levels** of indentation per function. Use guard clauses and helper functions to maintain this.

## Error Handling
- Use exceptions. Do not "log and raise"—either handle and log, or propagate.

## Quality & Testing
- **Tooling:** You must run `just lint` after changes; do not finish until it passes.
- **Testing:** Use `pytest` fixtures for mocks (avoid patching directly in tests). Use `mock.patch.object` for targeted patching. Use function tests (no class tests).
- **Privacy:** Accessing private members (`_member`) is permitted **only** in unit tests. Use `# noqa: SLF001` or directory-level linting overrides.

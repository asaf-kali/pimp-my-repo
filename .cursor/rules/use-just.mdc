This project uses `just` as an interface to common operations needed while developing.
Specifically, make sure to use `just test` and `just lint` after code changes.
Don't run any python commands directly - always use `just`. See `./justfile` if you need more info.

## Running tests

`just test` accepts extra args passed directly to pytest. Use them to narrow the scope when appropriate:

- Run a specific file: `just test tests/test_foo.py`
- Run tests matching a name pattern: `just test -k "test_something"`
- Run tests with a marker: `just test -m "smoke"`
- Combine: `just test tests/test_foo.py -k "test_bar" -s`

Use `just test-fast` to run only smoke-marked tests quickly.
